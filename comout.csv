Low Rec,It was all very nice.,The vip tour was nice but there isn't enough to do everything. We only got to do one thing in each of the villages. I would not recommend that people have a large lunch. Dinner came too quickly and we did not enjoy it as much since we were still full.,
Low Rec,,
Low Rec,We really enjoyed getting to learn more about each of the cultures. The layout and design of the grounds was unique and it added to the experience. The canoe show was fun to take in. The Luau dinner was delicious and the dinner show was nice. The Ha Breath of Life show was amazing. I am so glad we decided to sign up for it. We also really enjoyed the morning tour we received of the island. Our tour guide (Donovan) was really knowledgeable and appeared to really enjoy his job and teach us about the culture and history of the island. We really had a lot of fun with him.,"We wish we had more time to spend at the center. We felt a bit rushed trying to take in all of the shows at the different areas. By ensuring we dedicated all of our time to the shows we did not look into participating in any of the other activities each of the villages had to offer. However I do understand that it is a bit hard to try and fit in an island tour,
Low Rec,,
Low Rec,The island exhibits and the performers. Your staff was uniformly outstanding.,there should be a more organized way to see the most activities instead of using a guide.,

Low Rec,,
Low Rec,the Breath of LIfe show,Your whole facility needs education about handicapped accessibility and sensitivity. I have attended many parks and or cultural events all across the US and I was both embarrassed and disappointed at the lack of accessibility in your facility as well as the lack of sensitivity of the staff to the handicapped patrons. Standing in line for the luau rather than being allowed ot move to the front of the line are a separate entrance for wheelchairs and or scooters is one suggestion.,
Low Rec,Ha Breath of Life,Culture of village shows needs to take notes from Samoa show,
Low Rec, and the hall & staff were wonderful.",
Low Rec,,
Low Rec,some of the shows at the villages were fun.  kap was amazing!,"Should open the grounds earlier as it would be really hard for people to actually come a second day.  I managed to get in all the shows at the different villages but could not take on most of the activities.  For the river show,

Low Rec,Ha: Breath of Life,Was not expecting a buffet... Prefer plated meal,
Low Rec,"Ushers need to do a better job of making sure people are sitting in their assigned seats. Either by leading people to their seats or taking active notice of when people are having trouble. An entire family of 5 sat down in the row in front of us, and when another family came to claim their seats,

Low Rec,Our guide was great.,Seating at the breath of life. I paid for a front row seat but could not get the wheel chair down there. Also the seats are way to small. I couldn't fit in the seat and I'm not really that big. That was a very big disappointed moment for me.,

Low Rec, I felt further frustrated by the continued claim that PCC has the best Luau.  Basically, none of what was said about the Luau was true.  Please work on your quality control.",
Low Rec,Ha breath of life show,Tour - we could have skipped the billage shows for other activities in the villages and interacted with the people more,
Low Rec,,"We bought just the general admission tickets and were told we could take an early bus back (as we had our 18 mo grand daughter with us) but there was no bus for us. People at the ticket counter were lost on how to help us leave at 6:30 so the only thing they did was give us free tickets to the evening show. So we saw the show (fantastic) but had to keep the little one way past her evening time. We arenâ€™t complaining but when we are told there is an early bus,

Low Rec,Samoa village,I didn't particularly like the division in access and services because of ticket purchased. I understand it. Specifically in two areas. The roped off seating for the Canoe show and seating at the luau buffet.,
Low Rec,,The store was hard to understand.  How does all the different island cultures tie together?  Are they traveling from island to island?,
Low Rec,dinner is wonderful,All day activities are a little overwhelming and redundant. Hopefully will allow more choices/prices for different combinations of activities,
Low Rec,The show was wonderful!,The food was not very good.,
